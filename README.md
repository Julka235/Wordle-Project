# Wordle Game in Python and Pygame

## Description

This project implements a version of the popular Wordle game using English words. It includes a graphical interface and allows players to input letters either by clicking an on-screen keyboard or typing on their physical keyboard.

## Installation

1. Install Python 3.10.12.
2. Install the pygame 2.5.2 library using:
'''
    pip install pygame
'''

## How to Play

1. Run the main.py file.
2. Enter 5-letter English words using either:
    - Your physical keyboard.
    - The on-screen keyboard by clicking its buttons.
3. Press Enter to submit the word. If the word is invalid, delete it using Backspace and try again.

### Game Rules

- You have 6 attempts to guess the correct word.
- The game provides color-coded hints based on the standard Wordle rules:
    - Green: The letter is correct and in the correct position.
    - Yellow: The letter is correct but in the wrong position.
    - Gray: The letter is not in the word.
- If you guess the word, all letters will turn green, and "YOU WON!" will be displayed.
- If you fail, the correct word will be shown after 6 attempts.

### Game Options

- Try Again: Start a new game.
- Give Up: Reveal the correct word and end the current game.

## Project Overview

The project consists of three main files:

- classes.py: Contains the core logic of the game.
    - Key Classes:
      - Database: Handles loading and validating word lists.
      - Guesswords: Manages the list of possible answers.
      - ValidWords: Checks if a word is valid.
      - Solution: Implements the logic for checking guesses and providing feedback.
- main.py: Implements the graphical interface and gameplay interactions.
- test_classes.py: Contains test cases to validate the functionality of classes.py.

### Technical Details

- Word lists:
  - guesswords.txt: For generating random solutions.
  - valid_words.txt: For validating user input.
- Both lists are pre-processed for compatibility and efficiency.
- Dependencies:
  - Python 3.10.12.
  - Pygame 2.5.2.

### Testing

Key test cases include:

- Validating word searches in ValidWords:
  - Words not in the list.
  - First/last words in the list.
  -  Out-of-bounds cases.
- Testing color feedback in Solution:
  - Duplicate letters in guesses and the solution.
  - Matching letters in different positions.
  - Exact match of the guess with the solution.

## Objective

The goal is to recreate the Wordle experience with an intuitive graphical interface and multiple input methods, making it easy and enjoyable to play.
